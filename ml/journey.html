            <div id="describe"> Hi everyone, this is my journey into Data Science and ML learning. This is a sort of blog to trace, days after days, my attempt to learn ML.
            I got no degree, but at this moment I planned to get some certs in the topic.</div>

                        <li>My knowledges approximate zero. I did enroll myself into <i>Machine Learning</i> by Andrew NG, Stanford, Coursera.</li>
                        <li>I also started a very practical maths book called <a href="https://github.com/atomicwelding/papers/blob/master/data_science_ml_dl/basics_of_linear_algebrea_for_machine_learning_brownlee.pdf"><i>Basics of Linear Algebra for Machine Learning by Brownlee.</i></a></li>

                        <li>I learned so much about Linear Regressions from the first 2 weeks of the course ML by  Andrew NG. It is very useful and he doesn't neglect the maths side of machine learning which is really good. </li>
                        <li>I intensively used different sources to go deeper into linear algebra and calculus. Among them I consulted
